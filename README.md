# Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains examples of the **Singleton Pattern** and the **Visitor Pattern** in both **Java** and **JavaScript**. These patterns are fundamental software design patterns, offering elegant solutions to common problems.

## Singleton Pattern in Java

### Overview
The **Singleton Pattern** ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to that instance. It is useful when you need a single shared instance of a class, such as a **database connection** or a **logging service**.

### Files
- **`SingleObject.java`** - Contains the Singleton class.
- **`SingletonPatternDemo.java`** - Contains the main method to test the Singleton pattern.

## Visitor Pattern in Java

### Overview
The **Visitor Pattern** allows you to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the classes of the objects themselves. It separates concerns by allowing a "visitor" to perform a specific operation on elements of an object structure.

This pattern is particularly useful when:
- You need to perform different operations on objects of varying types within an object structure.
- You want to avoid polluting object classes with unrelated operations.

### Files
- **`ComputerPart.java`** - Interface for computer parts.
- **`Keyboard.java`, `Monitor.java`, `Mouse.java`, `Computer.java`** - Concrete classes for different computer parts.
- **`ComputerPartVisitor.java`** - Interface for the visitor.
- **`ComputerPartDisplayVisitor.java`** - Concrete visitor class for displaying parts.
- **`VisitorPatternDemo.java`** - Main class to test the Visitor pattern.

## Visitor Pattern in JavaScript

### Overview
In **JavaScript**, the **Visitor Pattern** is implemented differently compared to statically-typed languages like Java. JavaScript's dynamic typing allows for more flexibility in implementing this pattern, where we can pass objects as arguments and modify their behavior.

In this implementation, we define a `visit()` method in different visitor classes to handle operations on various object types (e.g., `Car`, `Truck`, `MonsterTruck`).

### Files
- **`visitorDemo.js`** - Contains all the classes and the implementation of the Visitor Pattern.

## Conclusion

In this repository, you have seen examples of the **Singleton Pattern** and **Visitor Pattern** implemented in both **Java** and **JavaScript**. These design patterns help organize code efficiently and solve common problems in software development:

- **Singleton Pattern** ensures a single instance of a class is shared globally.
- **Visitor Pattern** allows operations to be added to classes without modifying the classes themselves.
